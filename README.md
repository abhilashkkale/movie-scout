# MovieScout
- This is a Angular 6 project/web-app, which displays a dashboard having movie details on UI.

# Features / User interaction :
- The functionalities provided to the user are filtering, sorting and pagination on the table/grid.
- Filtering requires the user to select a particular filter type from the provided dropdown and then starting typing the keywords/terms for filtering/searching in the input box provided.
- The filter results are immediate based on user input and thus reflects simultaneously in the table/grid as the user types.
- User can sort the details based on ascending or descending.
- If a sorting is applied and then user tries to filter then the applied sorting is removed from all columns, once the user starts typing the filter terms. This is to avoid ambiguity in table/grid data.
- The information displayed on UI is paginated by default, which species 10 rows as page size. User can then navigate back and forth as required.
